# ðŸ’¥ Fluent Marvel API ðŸ’¥
The goal of this project is to make access to the Marvel Comics API as simple as possible using the .NET framework.

This is .NET Core 6.0 class library fluently designed to access data via the official [Marvel Comic API](https://developer.marvel.com/).

**This is a work in progress repo, and is subject to change while it is before 1.0. Especially since, as of this writing, there isn't actually a NuGet package yet!**

> Every Day is a Learning Day

## Background
The intention of this repository is to build a modern SDK using a Fluent design patter to view all of the data available via the Marvel Comics API. This is an exercise in learning for me, but my goal is to make this as robust as possible.

In order to use this SDK, you'll have to register for your own account at the [Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.arvel.com/).

In sync with the API, this supports the following resources:
* Comics
* Characters
* Series
* Stories
* Events
* Creators

## Usage
Instantiating a new api service class:
```cs
string privateKey = "abcde"; // Add yours here
string publicKey = "yourpublicKey"; // Add yours here

var marvelApi = MarvelApiService(privateKey, privateKey);
```

Querying the data can be done via a series of chained method calls.  Each of these method calls continues to refine the builder and filter the ultimate query results.

The final method call (`Excelsior()`) executes the query against the API and returns the results.

```cs
var amazingSpiderMan69 = await marvelApi.GetComics()
    .WithTitleStartingWith("The Amazing Spider-Man")
    .WithIssueNumber(69)
    .StartingWithSeriesYear(1963)
    .InFormatOf(ComicFormats.Comic)
    .Excelsior();
```

Additionally, the API can cross reference multiple resources with each other.  For example, query for the top 5 comics that are not a variant where both Captain America (Steve Rogers) `1009220` and Captain America (Sam Wilson) `1017575` appear together.

```cs
var comicsWithSteveAndSam = await marvelApi.GetComics()
    .RemoveVariants()
    .WithAllCharacters(1009220, 1017575)
    .LimitResultsBy(5)
    .Excelsior()
```
